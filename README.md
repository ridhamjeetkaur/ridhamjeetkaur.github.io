## Tom Tom Api is used for Location based applications. it provide 6 different products to make our application.
 1. Map API Make static and interactive maps and web apps
 2. Traffic API = Flow details of traffic jams. Incidents on road.
 3. search API = Search for address or place. Query Interface
 4. Routing API = plans our route from ato b. (under real time traffic conditions)
 5. Geofencing API - manage thousands of beautifyl boundariesfrom one location, fence management, fence reports
 6. maps sdk = for android , ios, web

# Traffic API:
### Related to traffic. The Traffic API is service designed for developers to create web and mobile applications around real-time traffic. These web services can be used via RESTful APIs.
## In traffic API we consider two API:
### 1. Traffic incident Api = It give us event happening on road . As a service API, it can be used to fetch events in a bounded box(an area in a map). It is also used by SDK to display incidents.This provides an accurate view about traffic jams and incidents around a road network.
### 2. Traffic flow API = this give how fast  or slow are street segments doing(eg = how traffic is going slow or fast) . This provides real time observed speeds and travel times for all key roads in a network.
## Using Tom Tom predict traffic flow:
### Step !: Add map to website :Add a map to your website =https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqpZFsM7vII&ab_channel=TomTom[Link_text]
### Step 2: Add traffic flow and incident layer to map. =https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKwF-F7LJPw&ab_channel=TomTom
### Adding more, we can make route app with tom tom.
